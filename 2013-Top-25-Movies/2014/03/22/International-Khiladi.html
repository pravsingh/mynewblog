<p>An orphan boy, named Sunil, wanders through all of Delhi looking for a job. When selling balloons, he sees a girl and gives her a free balloon. A few days later, during a storm, the girl finds the boy getting soaked and gives him an umbrella. The umbrella blows into a place nearby, where the girls parents are headed. The boy stops their car and indicates them about the dangerous path ahead destroyed by the storm. As the boy rescues the girl&rsquo;s parents, the boy gets adopted by the parents. They name the boy &ldquo;Atithi&rdquo; which means &ldquo;guest&rdquo;. One day, while driving Atithi to a hostel, they are stopped by a teenager, a Psychopath, who mugs them, and shoots the parents. In his rage, Athithi lunges after the teen managing to take the teen&rsquo;s gun. Nearby witnesses see Athithi with a gun and the girl&rsquo;s parents and think that Atithi killed them. The police come and arrest Atithi. The girl also thinks that it was Atithi who killed her parents and starts to hate him and thinks that she will never see him again. Fourteen years later, Atithi gets out of jail, and is now in search of the Psychopath {teen who has killed the girl&rsquo;s parents} and the girl who is alive. In Delhi, local goons are feared by Atithi, as he becomes a hurdle for their illegal operation. At one instance, he runs across a girl named Amrita chased by stalkers from her college. Amrita and Atithi meet many times. Amrita starts to like Atithi, but has to go back to Hyderabad before she can confess her love. When she goes to try tell him that she is leaving Atithi gets annoyed. He continuously tells her to leave him alone, when she keeps asking to get some coffee and slaps her. She runs away crying. Later Atithi goes to Amrita to say sorry but only finds her friend. She tells him that Amrita just wanted to tell him that she&rsquo;s leaving. They then go to the cemetery seeing if she is there. Amrita&rsquo;s friend then explains that a boy adopted by Amrita&rsquo;s parents killed them when she was young and Amrita goes to the cemetery to see their graves all the time. Atithi realizes that she was the same girl that he met in his childhood and leaves for Hyderabad to find her. When Atithi also arrives to Hyderabad, and decides to stay with Amrita&rsquo;s family, he learns that a Mafia leader and kidnapper named Kaiser is feared there. Later, after few events, Atithi realizes that Kaiser was the psychopath teen who killed the girl&rsquo;s parents. Now Kaiser is trying to kill Amrita. Atithi stops two attempts by Kaiser to murder Amrita. Meanwhile, Officer Ajay is trying to track down Kaiser. Ajay dies in an explosion in his house, which was planned by Kaiser. Atithi figures out later on that Ajay is none other than Kaiser. Ajay&rsquo;s real name is Kaiser. Before Kaiser&rsquo;s house blew up, Kaiser managed to escape. When the MLA realizes that Ajay&rsquo;s real name is Kaiser, the MLA, after succumbing to shock, dies with a heart attack. Athithi manages to kill one of Kaiser&rsquo;s men. Kaiser then kidnaps Amrita and her cousin. Kaiser kills Amrita&rsquo;s cousin. Then Kaiser leads Amrita to a dungeon and calls Atithi and tells him that he will kill Amrita if Atithi doesn&rsquo;t rescue her in 12 hours. Then Atithi kidnaps Kaiser&rsquo;s brother, and trades for Amrita. Amrita is severely cut and stuck in a certain air tank (Kaiser planned), but is rescued. Kaiser is killed. Atithi and Amrita unite, realising he wasn&rsquo;t the one who killed her parents.</p>
