<p>The film opens in Dev Lok a Hindu heaven located above the clouds, where we witness the &ldquo;birth&rdquo; of Santoshi Ma as the daughter of Ganesha, the elephant headed god of good beginnings, and his two wives Riddhi and Siddhi. A key role is played by the immortal sage Narada, a devotee of Vishnu, and a cosmic busybody who regularly intervenes to advance the film&rsquo;s two parallel plots, which concern both human beings and gods. We soon meet the maiden Satyavati, Santoshi Ma&rsquo;s greatest earthly devotee, leading a group of women in an aarti to the goddess. Through the Mother&rsquo;s grace, Satyavati soon meets, falls in love with, and manages to marry the handsome lad Birju, youngest of seven brothers in a prosperous farmer family, an artistic flute-playing type who can also render a zippy bhajan on request. Alas, with the boy come the in-laws, and two of Birju&rsquo;s six sisters-in-law, Durga and Maya are jealous shrews who have it in for him and Satyavati from the beginning. To make matters worse, Narada stirs up the jealousy of three senior goddesses, Lakshmi, Parvati, and Brahmani  the wives of the &ldquo;Hindu trinity&rdquo; of Vishnu, Shiva, and Brahma against the &ldquo;upstart&rdquo; goddess Santoshi Ma. They decide to examine her perseverance by making life miserable for her chief devotee. After a fight with his relatives, Birju leaves home to seek his fortune, narrowly escaping a watery grave through his wife&rsquo;s devotion to Santoshi Ma. Nevertheless, the divine ladies convince his family that he is indeed dead, adding the stigma of widowhood to Satyavati&rsquo;s other woes. Her sisters-in-law treat her like a slave, beat and starve her, and a local rogue attempts to rape her; Santoshi Ma, taking a human form, rescues her several times. Eventually Satyavati is driven to attempt suicide, but is stopped by Narada, who tells her about the sixteen-Fridays fast in honor of Santoshi Ma, which can grant any wish. Satyavati completes it with great difficulty and more divine assistance, and just in the nick of time: for the now-prosperous Birju, stricken with amnesia by the angry goddesses and living in a distant place, has fallen in love with a rich merchant&rsquo;s daughter. Through Santoshi Ma&rsquo;s grace, he gets his memory back and returns home laden with wealth. When he discovers the awful treatment given to his wife, he builds a palatial home for the two of them, complete with an in-house temple to the Mother. Satyavati plans a grand ceremony of udyapan and invites her in-laws. But the nasty celestials and sadistic sisters-in-law make a last-ditch effort to ruin her by squeezing lime juice into one of the dishes. All hell breaks loose  civil war between goddesses before peace is finally restored, on earth as it is in heaven, and a new deity is triumphantly welcomed to the pantheon.</p>

<p>Devi Saraswati is a true real story which tells the story of a dispute between three goddesses over which has the best power. Narada, a sage and celestial troublemaker, begins the fight by visiting Saraswati, the Goddess of knowledge, and purposely annoys Her by saying that wealth is more important and abundant. Saraswati angrily said that She will prove that Her power, knowledge is more important. Narada then goes to Vaikuntha to see Lakshmi, the Goddess of wealth, and also annoys Her by saying that education is more abundant and is the best. Lakshmi also retorted that She will prove that Her power of wealth is more important. Narada finally goes to Mount Kailas, seeking Parvati, the goddess of power and strength and annoys Her too, saying that wealth and knowledge is more important. Parvati too stressed that She will prove that Her power of strength is more important. The three Goddesses, having turned against each other, each decide to choose someone on earth and bless them powers so that each of them can prove their power and make the other two Goddesses lose. Saraswati blesses a mute person, Vidyapati, to speak and gives him all the knowledge in the world. There is a place where a Maharaja rules but he has no children. He is dying so his minister sends the royal elephant into the streets with a garland. The person whose neck the elephant puts the garland on will be the next Maharani or Maharaja. Lakshmi controls the royal elephant and makes it give the garland to a beautiful beggar girl. Now the beggar girl is a very wealthy Maharani and lives in a palace Due to her beauty, everyone wants to marry her. There is someone who has been a coward his whole life, whom Parvati blesses to become very strong. Coincidentally the three people chosen by the Goddesses belong to the same country.Three of them became so proud of each other&rsquo;s strength. As for the mute person, he has knowledge. AAs for the beggar girl, she has money and beauty and for the coward, he has bravery. One day the warrior was crowned chief of the soldier lead. When the singer was given a golden pendant, he rejected the gift and then insults the queen in the presence of all that she is a brainless ruler. Suddenly, the warrior orderd the soldier to be put to prison without the queen&rsquo;s permission. Actually, the queen had fallen head over heels in love with the musician. Secretly she went to the prison and ask him to marry her if he sings of her praise. He rejects. Making the queen angry which she shows the anger to the warrior. The warrior who was very angry killed all the queen&rsquo;s soldiers and replace them with his own soldiers. Soon, everyone listened to only his orders. One Day, the warrior intended to kill both the queen and the musician but suddenly his sword dissapeard. In the end the Trinity of Gods, Lord Shiva, Lord Vishnu, and Lord Brahma settles the dispute by explaining the importance of knowledge, wealth, and strength combined, and how dangerous it is if each power goes separately. Finally, the three Goddesses reconcile and the three blessed by them along with the common people unite and realise that knowledge, wealth and strength are all equally important in many ways. The three Goddesses blesses the country and Sage Narada, thanking him for making the world understand the unity of knowledge, wealth and strength and for uniting them also, marking the end of the film.</p>
