Shrinath is a wicked man who wants to take over Raghupathi's wealth and manages to do so by killing Ram, separating Lakshmi and her son Vijay and in the process framing Lakshman for murder. Years later, Lakshman, still in prison, is informed that Raghupathi has been conned by Shrinath and his son, Monty; and they have hired an impersonator, who has killed Raghupathi and taken over the estate.
