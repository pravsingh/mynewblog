<p>The Story is about Rosy who is a wheelchair-using cancer patient, who lives in an orphanage along with other orphans. She is very rude and uncaring towards anyone. She even illtreats her caretaker. When Rajinikanth, who acts as himself in the movie, visits the orphanage, Rosy also illtreats him, not knowing that he is Rajinikanth. But after watching a few movies of his, she becomes a big fan of Rajinikanth and the latter also develops a special bond with her, taking her out for his shooting and to many other places. Rosy&rsquo;s attitude also undergoes a change due to this relationship as she becomes a kind and considerate girl. When Rosy dies on Christmas Eve due to the cancer, she stills holds Rajinikanth&rsquo;s hand, and Rajinikanth starts crying, such was their affection for each other.</p>
