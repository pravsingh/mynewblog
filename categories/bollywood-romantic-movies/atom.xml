<p>Lamington Road on Bombay&rsquo;s Western Railway is the nearest railway station that takes one to Kamathipura, notorious for it&rsquo;s red-light, in particular, and a crime-prone area in general. It is in this area, on a stormy rainy day, that wealthy Aman Kapoor&rsquo;s car breaks down. His efforts to call for help via his cell phone are in vain, and he takes shelter in a nearby building. This is where he comes in contact with a prostitute named Chameli &ndash; and this is where his nightmare involving pimps, eunuchs, prostitutes, and corrupt police officers &ndash; will begin &ndash; and will seem to have no ending whatsoever.</p>
