<p>Family ties get twisted in this complex Bollywood saga centered around Sumitra (Rakhee Gulzar), an heiress whose son Anand (Mithun Chakraborty) is mistakenly raised by a foster mother, leaving Sumitra to believe that her servant&rsquo;s daughter (Rati Agnihotri) is actually her own. Now a grown man, Anand sets out to arrest the woman who killed his real father, unaware that she&rsquo;s his own mother. And things only grow more complicated from there.</p>
