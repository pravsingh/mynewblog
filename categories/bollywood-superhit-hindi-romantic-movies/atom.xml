<p>The story is centred on Ravi, a spoiled, good for nothing rich kid, the son of Deewan-saab, a successful businessman. Deewan-saab is increasingly disappointed in Ravi&rsquo;s behaviour, because all Ravi wants to do is hang out with his dodgy girlfriend Kamini, drinking, fighting, and gambling away all his father&rsquo;s money. So when Ravi shows no signs of growing up, Deewan-saab cuts him off  NO MORE GAMBLING MONEY FOR RAVI!  Gauri  the village girl is seemingly incredibly na?ve. she hangs out with a bunch of kids. Then her pregnant friend Seema arrives in the village and enlightens her a bit more as to the ways of the world telling her something about how a baby is made on the wedding night and how it involves the groom entering the bedroom and drinking a glass of milk and then BOOM, BABY. Unfortunately, that happens anyway, quite traumatically, when Gauri witnesses Seema dying violently in childbirth. So, understandably, she&rsquo;s not especially willing, when the time comes, to marry Ravi. Nor is Ravi willing to marry Gauri. Ravi is a massive spoiled brat, and is in love with Kamini, and when Deewan-saab issues Ravi with the ultimatum get married to Gauri or no paisa for you, son, Ravi&rsquo;s response is an exceedingly mature emo scream: &ldquo;If I have to marry, it&rsquo;s Kamini or NO-ONE!&rdquo;</p>

While on a trip to Simla, she meets and falls in love with Prem, and they get intimate with each other. Prem asks Heerachand for his daughter&rsquo;s hand in marriage. But Preeti&rsquo;s father refuses, on the ground that the hard-up Prem is not worthy of her. Prem leaves Preeti a note, explaining that her father refused the alliance and that he is heading to meet his mother, who is very sick. Heerachand gets hold of the letter before Preeti. He changes the letter with a fake one that says Prem is going away because Heerachand has refused to provide any monetary compensation. Years later, Prem and Preeti are fated to meet again. This time, Prem is accompanied by a handicapped young boy, Rahul, while Preeti is about to get engaged to Dr. Amar. Preeti feels that Prem has re-appeared in her life in order to be near Dr. Amar&rsquo;s nubile sister, Tikki. Preeti does not know what to do under the circumstances; how to expose Prem as well as hide her past from Dr. Amar.</p>
