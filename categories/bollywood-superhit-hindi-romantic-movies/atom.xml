<p>The story is centred on Ravi, a spoiled, good for nothing rich kid, the son of Deewan-saab, a successful businessman. Deewan-saab is increasingly disappointed in Ravi&rsquo;s behaviour, because all Ravi wants to do is hang out with his dodgy girlfriend Kamini, drinking, fighting, and gambling away all his father&rsquo;s money. So when Ravi shows no signs of growing up, Deewan-saab cuts him off  NO MORE GAMBLING MONEY FOR RAVI!  Gauri  the village girl is seemingly incredibly na?ve. she hangs out with a bunch of kids. Then her pregnant friend Seema arrives in the village and enlightens her a bit more as to the ways of the world telling her something about how a baby is made on the wedding night and how it involves the groom entering the bedroom and drinking a glass of milk and then BOOM, BABY. Unfortunately, that happens anyway, quite traumatically, when Gauri witnesses Seema dying violently in childbirth. So, understandably, she&rsquo;s not especially willing, when the time comes, to marry Ravi. Nor is Ravi willing to marry Gauri. Ravi is a massive spoiled brat, and is in love with Kamini, and when Deewan-saab issues Ravi with the ultimatum get married to Gauri or no paisa for you, son, Ravi&rsquo;s response is an exceedingly mature emo scream: &ldquo;If I have to marry, it&rsquo;s Kamini or NO-ONE!&rdquo;</p>
