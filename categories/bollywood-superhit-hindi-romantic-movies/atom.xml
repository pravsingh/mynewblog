<p>Preeti is a wealthy young woman living in Mumbai with her widower father, Heerachand. She is a medical student. While on a trip to Simla, she meets and falls in love with Prem, and they get intimate with each other. Prem asks Heerachand for his daughter&rsquo;s hand in marriage. But Preeti&rsquo;s father refuses, on the ground that the hard-up Prem is not worthy of her. Prem leaves Preeti a note, explaining that her father refused the alliance and that he is heading to meet his mother, who is very sick. Heerachand gets hold of the letter before Preeti. He changes the letter with a fake one that says Prem is going away because Heerachand has refused to provide any monetary compensation. Years later, Prem and Preeti are fated to meet again. This time, Prem is accompanied by a handicapped young boy, Rahul, while Preeti is about to get engaged to Dr. Amar. Preeti feels that Prem has re-appeared in her life in order to be near Dr. Amar&rsquo;s nubile sister, Tikki. Preeti does not know what to do under the circumstances; how to expose Prem as well as hide her past from Dr. Amar.</p>
