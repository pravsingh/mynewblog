<p>The Story is about Sapna, lives a fairly isolated life, though publicly she is thronged by fans, and has taken to drinking to ease her loneliness. Intoxicated, she runs her vehicle into a young man named Pappu, who suffers minor injuries. He recognizes her and tells her that he is her number-one fan and will do anything for her. She wants him to kill her double-timing boyfriend, Rahu. He agrees to do so, provided she kills his overbearing grandmother, to which she agrees. After Pappu completes his gruesome task, he meets with Sapna, only to be told that she does not recognize him, but when presented with proof, she relents and agrees to fulfill her part of this trade. She, along with Kokibhai, arrive at the palatial home of Pappu&rsquo;s grandmother and set out to kill her. ACP Kamat already has evidence linking Pappu to Rahul&rsquo;s sudden death and has been keeping a close eye on his whereabouts.
