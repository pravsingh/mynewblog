In the palace, Sinharan is asking the people to punish him for the mistakes he has committed.     &lsquo;Chanakya&rsquo; was a renounced Indian scholar and teacher to the Maurya Emperor Chandragupta. We bring you Dr. Chandraprakash Dwivedi&rsquo;s popular television series &lsquo;Chanakya&rsquo;, a 47-part Indian television historical drama that won the prestigious Uptron Awards in the year 1992.
