<p>&lsquo;Chanakya&rsquo; was a renowned Indian scholar and teacher to the Maurya Emperor Chandragupta. We bring you Dr. Chandraprakash Dwivedi&rsquo;s popular television series &lsquo;Chanakya&rsquo;, a 47-part Indian television historical drama that won the prestigious Uptron Awards in the year 1992. The series takes us through the life of Chanakya, his works &ndash; Chanakya Neeti and Arthasastra. His teachings on politics, economics and social welfare can be used even today in the modern world. The narration of the story has been kept simple to match up with the finest details that begin from the early life of Vishnugupta (Chanakya) in the kingdom of Magadha to the historic rebellion against Alexander under the leadership of Chandragupta Maurya and ends with the coronation of Chandragupta Maurya as the King of Magadha. The critically acclaimed show is definitely worth watching for its authentic costumes, artistic value and most importantly to strengthen our relationship with the Indian history.</p>
