<p>Shikshaa is the story of a modern youth&rsquo;s awakening. The youth is Vijay Gupta, the only son of the rich Raj Saheb Dwarkadas Gupta and Laxmi Gupta. He was spoiled by the over-indulgence and affection showered by his mother. Thanks to his own irresponsible behaviour, bad company and reckless driving, his car met with an accident in which one man died and his brother lost his eyes. Unmindful, Vijay drove away. The loyal driver of the family, Kundan took the blame for the accident and went to jail. Vijay&rsquo;s father who was a strict disciplinarian rebuked his son for his carelessness and unforgivable crime. In a huff, Vijay left home pledging that he would live his own life and would not divulge to anyone his identity. And Vijay kept up his pledge. Without any recommendation, he got a job as a driver in Kamal Rai&rsquo;s house. By coincidence, Kamal Rai happened to be a great friend of Vijay&rsquo;s father and he had a daughter whom he wanted to marry his friend&rsquo;s son Vijay. Though the daughter Madhu found out Vijay&rsquo;s true identity, she kept it a secret from everyone. Madhu however fell in love with Vijay.
