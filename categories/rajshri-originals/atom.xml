<p>When Sapna &ndash; the sensational stage singer of national fame &ndash; comes to perform in her small native town, everyone is thrilled and excited. Inspector Kumar personally supervises all the arrangements of the show. Sapna&rsquo;s phenomenal success is his personal triumph. It was he who had persuaded Sapna &ndash; then a pick-pocket &ndash; to give up the path of crime and be a &ldquo;Good Girl&rdquo;. Few people knew the burden of guilt that he carried within his heart : How one evening Sapna had asked him whether he would agree to marry her and how he had hesitated. She had gone away, determined to be Somebody and today she had returned as a successful, renowned singer.But in the meantime, Inspector Kumar had spent innumerable sleepless nights thinking over his hesitation and now that he had come to love her, the gulf between the two appears unbridgeable.  Today Sapna was wealthy, famous and successful star-singer while he remained only a humble police officer! What happens when the two protagonists meet face to face &ldquo;Jazbaat&rdquo; is the answer!</p>

<p>A simple, yet interesting romantic movie, &lsquo;Chitchor&rsquo; revolves around Vinod  &ndash; Amol Palekar who falls in love with Geeta &ndash; Zarina Wahab after her family mistakes him for someone else. When the misunderstanding about Vinod&rsquo;s identity is cleared, it seems that he may have to lose Geeta for no fault of his. This Basu Chatterji film boasts of a sterling performance by Master Rajoo and an excellent music score by Ravindra Jain, which contains soulful songs like &lsquo;Gori Tera Gaon&rsquo;, &lsquo;Jab Deep Jale Aana&rsquo;, &lsquo;Tu Jo Mere Sur Mein&rsquo; and &lsquo;Aaj Se Pehle&rsquo;.</p>
