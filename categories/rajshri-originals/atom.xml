After having lost his daughter Thakur had brought up Shyam as his own son. Strange are the ways of fate. Though Thakur was really Radha's father he was bent upon destroying her love and happiness. And Rana who had brought up Radha as his daughter was willing to sacrifice everything for her happiness, but he proved powerless against Thakur's might. And the time came when Thakur was about to kill his own daughter Radha. At that very moment, the doll which was Radha's childhood companion came to her rescue by revealing the truth and re-uniting the lovers.
