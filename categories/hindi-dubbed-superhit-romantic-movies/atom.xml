After many years, Neelakanta&rsquo;s wife gives a birth to a baby daughter. But all the earlier babies born to Neelakanta Naidu died due to some unknown reason. The priests advise Neelakanta to name his daughter as &lsquo;Gangotri&rsquo;. They also warn Neelakanta that the child has &lsquo;jalagandam&rsquo;, hence they ask Neelakanta to take Gangotri to the holy place of Gangotri in Himalayas and perform the &lsquo;abhyangana snanam&rsquo; for the next 15 years. After 15 years, Gangotri would be free of any danger. When nobody could entertain the child Gangotri, Simhadri &ndash; the son of Narasimha &ndash; entertains her with a song. Simhadri becomes a servant and friend to Gangotri. They grow up together. In the mean time mother of Simhadri sacrifices her life to save Neelakantam. When Gangotri attains puberty, Gangotri&rsquo;s aunt restricts Simhadri from meeting Gangotri. Gangotri and Simhadri realize that they are in love. When Simhadri comes to Gangotri&rsquo;s place clandestinely to meet her, they are caught by Neelakantam. Neelakantam beats Simhadri. Meanwhile, Narasimha comes to the spot and interferes. This causes a rift between Neelakantam and Narasimha. Neelakantam is misinformed about Narasimha&rsquo;s intentions; hence he has bombs planted in the house of Narasimha. Simhadri is away at that time. When Simhadri comes to know that Neelakantam is responsible for the bombing, he comes to Neelakantam&rsquo;s house and challenges that he will marry Gangotri in 365 days.

<p>The movie opens with Lord Vishnu trying to pacify Lakshmi Devi , who is quite disappointed after listening to words of Narada that Lord Vishnu didn&rsquo;t gave any present to Lakshmi Devi on the eve of her Birthday. Lord Vishnu shows a love story between 2 orphans Ravi Teja, a settlement broker in Hyderabad and Ileana, a taxi driver living in Bangkok. Panileni Papayya sits at a shop, eats a banana &amp; throws the peel on the road. Using the peel, Lakshmi Devi creates a small problem which leads C.I. Subbaraju killing Sandy, a trusted goon of the absent-minded Don Prakash Raj of Bangkok. Thus to settle the problem between the two, Ravi Teja goes to Bangkok. At the airport, a taxi driver Goli steals the bag of Ravi Teja which has his belongings including passport. He chases him in Ileana&rsquo;s cab but his efforts are in vain. Feeling bad upon learning he is an orphan like her, Ileana invites Ravi Teja to her home. Next day he finds Goli, who is a die-hard devotee of Lakshmi Devi and meets Prakash Raj through him and settles the problem. Prakash Raj, who lusts after Ileana, asks Ravi Teja to send Ileana for a night. He bashes his entire team and runs to Ileana who is already in love with him. Both quarrel and get separated. Unhappy with the turn of events, Lakshmi Devi goes into the past and makes Papayya throw the Banana peel into a dust bin instead on the road. Due to this the story turns like this: Sandy is caught red-handed by Subbaraju and Sandy is sent to jail. As Sandy is a trusted goon and has all the information regarding his activities, Prakash Raj is furious and wants Sandy released. Ravi Teja is appointed by Prakash Raj&rsquo;s henchmen to strike a deal between Subbaraju and Prakash Raj. Both Ravi Teja and Subbaraju go to Bangkok. At the airport he sees Ileana for the first time and falls in love with her, due to which he refuses to sit in the taxi of Goli and sits in her taxi. Meanwhile Prakash Raj&rsquo;s men chase them in Goli&rsquo;s Taxi. During the chase, Subbaraju, Ravi Teja and Ileana are safe but their taxi is destroyed. After a long argument, Ravi Teja promises to buy a taxi when the deal is over and stay at Ileana&rsquo;s house as Subbaraju is injured. Meanwhile Ravi Teja flirts with Ileana which infuriates her. Both go to Prakash Raj and settle the problem for  2 crore. Prakash Raj sees his sister in Ileana and is ready to do anything for her. Ileana accepts him as her brother. Meanwhile Ravi Teja proposes to Ileana to which she accepts happily. At the time of closing of deal, Prakash Raj brings the  20 million but Subbaraju comes with Police. Meanwhile Ravi Teja &amp; Ileana quarrel but both hug each other, expressing their love. Finally after a fight sequence, Ravi Teja &amp; Ileana are shown to live a happy life &amp; Prakash Raj is a member of their family who would return to their home after six months of imprisonment. The whole story is seen by Lakshmi Devi and Lord Vishnu is successful in making her happy.</p>

<p>The Story is about Vicky, an expert in gaming software, lives in Australia and never compromises in his life, a principle he adheres to since his childhood. He believes that one should be oneself in a relationship and one shouldn&rsquo;t change one&rsquo;s orientation for the sake of the partner. He also encourages his friends to follow his principle of life. But Vicky&rsquo;s principles and attitude leads to a clash of interests with his father, who constantly advises him to adjust his character for his and other&rsquo;s happiness but to no avail. Meanwhile in India, Vicky&rsquo;s parents arrange a wedding alliance between him and Priya, Vicky&rsquo;s childhood friend who is a doctor by profession. She and Vicky are poles apart; while Vicky is modern in his thinking and is not ready to compromise with his life, Priya is traditional and conservative and is ready to compromise for the happiness of others. Initially, Vicky and Priya do not get along well, and both play practical jokes on one another. But later, on her father&rsquo;s advice, Priya attempts to change her attitude towards Vicky. Soon Priya falls in love with Vicky and changes in many ways for him, such as giving up her love of classical dance as Vicky does not like it, eating non-vegetarian food and wearing modern dresses. Vicky too begins to fall in love with her and is ready to accept the wedding proposal until he finds out that Priya has compromised on her interests for his sake. He rejects the wedding proposal and returns to Australia. Back in Australia, Vicky is matched up through a Cadbury survey with Maggie, a free-spirited modern girl who shares his no-compromise attitude. Both of them meet at a mall and interested in each other, begin to date and soon decide to get married. However, Maggie&rsquo;s father is none other than the MindGames head&rsquo;s brother, who is unwilling to let Vicky marry Maggie. After much persuasion from Vicky, Maggie&rsquo;s father agrees to let Vicky marry Maggie on the condition that he should stay in his house for 4 days for Maggie&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s wedding and if Vicky manages to win over at least 2 relatives of Maggie, he can marry her and he would get a business in India else he should forget Maggie and leave the contract. But Vicky changes the condition that if at least 1 relative of Maggie does not get convinced that Vicky is the correct match for Maggie then he would forget Maggie and leave the contract, else he would marry Maggie and does not leave the contract. Soon, the relatives begin pouring in from India and among them, to Vicky&rsquo;s shock, is Priya, who happens to be the groom&rsquo;s cousin. During the 4 days, with the help of Priya, he manages to win over the entire family. It is clear that Vicky is going to win Maggie&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s challenge. Priya leaves for India on the night before Vicky wins the challenge, heartbroken at the thought that Vicky is marrying someone else. Vicky receives a message Priya had recorded prior to him rejecting her on his mobile phone where she had declared her love for him. He gains a change of heart on seeing this message and realises how much Priya had loved him and was willing to change for him, in spite of his faults. He also realises the need for compromises in life. Vicky conveys his feelings to all the wedding guests present and decides not to marry Maggie. Maggie understands his feelings and accepts his decision. Vicky returns to India to win back Priya. After initially playing hard-to-get, Priya accepts Vicky&rsquo;s love and they live happily ever after.</p>
