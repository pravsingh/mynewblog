<p>The Story is about Lakshmi is traveling with her nephew to an estate to attend her job interview as a nanny to the estate merchants daughter. There is a suspicious looking man seated in front of her, at a point in the journey he tries to rape her but suddenly he is shot dead. Lakshmi sees the murderer and clearly remembers his face and reports the murder to the police. Then she is appointed for the nanny position and she and the merchants daughter grow fond of each other. Then it is announced that the merchant who is extremely fond of his daughter has come back form his journey, Lakshmi meets him only to find that he is the murderer she saw on the train, the merchant realizes this as well and threatens Lakshmi not to tell anyone and makes sure to prevent her from leaving his estate as she is keen on reporting him to the police. Lakshmi tries many times to escape but does not succeed and is always caught. She doesn&rsquo;t even tell the police when she meets them as Rajini threatens that he will kill her nephew if she did. Later in the movie Lakshmi somehow sees beneath the rough, mean Rajini and grows fond of him but is confused why such a nice man is acting so arrogantly. Here a flashback is revealed where Rajini and his wife were completely in love and go married, soon after their daughter was born. Sripriya&rsquo;s uncle who was eager to marry Sripriya but who was sent to jail by Rajini as he tried to kill both Rajini and Sripriya was released from jail as his term had finished. Rajini had gone out to the shops and Sripriya&rsquo;s uncle breaks into their house and rapes Sripriya, due to this she commits suicide and Rajini wants to die with her but she makes him vow that he will get revenge on her uncle for separating them and to take care of their daughter well. Rajini also reveals that the man he killed on the train was Sripriya&rsquo;s evil uncle. Lakshmi now understands his acts and vows not to tell anyone. The police who Lakshmi had previously reported the murder to was curious about Lakshmi; She said that she remembered the face and was eager to find the murderer but now she had told him she has forgotten the face. Hence the police suspects Lakshmi to be the murderer. On Rajini daughter&rsquo;s birthday he is to announce that he is to hand over all his wealth to Lakshmi and surrender to the police but before this the police arrive and arrest Lakshmi, Lakshmi does not reveal Rajini as the real murderer and willingly goes to jail. It is here where Rajini goes to the police and confesses for the murder and goes to jail. Then a few years pass and they show Rajini released from jail and is reunited with Lakshmi and his daughter.</p>
