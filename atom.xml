<p>The Story is about Corrupt Central minister, is facing accusations over possessing black money of one lakh crore, and laundering it into Europe, through his un-suspecting daughter, Akanksha, a psychology student who goes to Barcelona to pursue higher education. Akanksha finds a diary in her flat in Barcelona, and out of curiosity she starts reading the book which unfolds the romantic drama between Sanju Reddy and Komal Shankarabharanam. Akanksha gets engaged in Paris with her father&rsquo;s hench man. Incidentally, she runs into Sanju Reddy, and gets to know him. Sanju is an engineer turned lead guitarist of a music band, and makes his living through street and stage performances. As narrated in the diary, Komal comes from an orthodox Telugu Brahmin family, into classical music, and ends up learning violin, at a musical school in Barcelona under Fiddle-professor Brahma. In a twist of fate, she falls in love with Sanju and gets approval for their inter caste marriage, from their parents in India. Komal unknowingly gets caught after a video footage that she accidentally shot while a henchman kills a Spanish Ambassador, in the process of money laundering. Sanju saves Komal from the henchman, on a couple of occasions; this is where the story in the diary ends abruptly. Out of curiosity Akanksha starts questioning Sanju about their love story and in the process ends up with disturbing facts. On continuous asking by Akanksha, Sanju tells her that Komal is dead. It is then shown in flashback that for fixing the marriage of Sanju &amp; Komal, their parents had come to Spain. It was at that time that Komal is kidnapped by the brother of Shawar Ali &amp; when Sanju comes to save her, Komal is murdered by the brother of Shawar Ali. In a fit of rage, Sanju bashes up the whole gang &amp; the brother of Shawar Ali goes into coma. On hearing this, Akanksha feels pity for Sanju &amp; falls in love with him. She also tries to bring Sanju out of the memory of Komal but in vain. Akanksha runs to Sanju to tell him about Komal and at that time, Sanju gets surrounded by the men of Shawar Ali. Sanju while bashing up his men, tells Akanksha that it was his plan to trap Akanksha in his love to avenge the death of his &amp; Komal&rsquo;s parents at the hands of Shawar Ali. It is then shown in flashback that after beating up the brother of Shawar Ali, Sanju had taken the body of Komal to the Hospital, from where Sanju&rsquo;s Dad calls up the Central Minister to arrest Shawar Ali in Spain, after watching the video footage. The Minister then calls up Shawar Ali to finish off this trouble in order to save himself. Shawar Ali, then goes to the hospital &amp; kills Sanju, his parents as well as Komal&rsquo;s parents. However, Sanju &amp; Komal do not die. It is then revealed that Sanju has been all this time waiting to get his revenge &amp; has made Akanksha his pawn in this game &amp; it was him only who faxed their photo in order to make Shawar Ali jealous, so that Shawar Ali will come himself to kill Sanju.</p>

<p>The Story is about &lsquo;Betting&rsquo; Raja who is a Hyderabad-based lucky guy who makes his living by betting. He lives with his adopted parents who support his means of living. Everything goes on as usual until tragedy strikes the family in the form of his father who is diagnosed with cirrhosis as a result of heavy drinking. Raj needs   2 million for his father&rsquo;s liver transplant, which must be done within a month. As he is on the lookout for money, he is approached by James, another bookie whom he had already met at an earlier competition, with a betting challenge. James dares Raj to make Chaitra, a dental student and the daughter of the powerful betting committee president Bellary to fall in love with him. If he is able to make her fall in love with him before the month end i.e. 31 December 2011, he would win   2 million. A desperate Raj, badly needing the money for his adopted father&rsquo;s operation, takes up the challenge and begins wooing Chaitra. Initially, Chaitra appears to spurn his advances and sets him even tougher challenges to propose her. Raj successfully overcomes all these challenges and Chaitra soon reciprocates his advances. Unfortunately, Bellary finds out about this relationship and sends his henchmen to kill the couple on the night of 31 December, the day Raj is to win his challenge. Raj successfully thwarts the henchmen and he and Chaitra escape to. Bellary, with the help of his corrupt minister-friend Baireddanna and the latter&rsquo;s Dubai-based son, begin a search for the couple. Meanwhile while Raj and Chaitra are on the run from Bellary&rsquo;s and Baireddanna&rsquo;s henchmen in Srisailam, James surprisingly appears and rescues them. At this juncture, Baireddanna&rsquo;s son appears, kidnaps Chaitra and stabs James. A wounded James then reveals to Raj about the latter&rsquo;s past. Raj was the son of Suryanarayana, a respected man in Rayadurg. Suryanarayana was best friends with a rich man Ramamurthy, whose daughter was Chaitra. Chaitra was a childhood friend of Raj. Suryanarayana&rsquo;s brother-in-law was none other than Bellary, who had found out about the presence of iron ore under Ramamurthy&rsquo;s land. He and Baireddanna decided to exploit the ore for their sinister purposes. When Suryanarayana and Ramamurthy objected to this, Bellary, Baireddanna and their henchemen killed them and their families, except Raj and Chaitra. Chaitra was adopted by Bellary, who planned to kill her when she became a major, so that he could acquire Ramamurthy&rsquo;s land. Chaitra, who already knew about Raj&rsquo;s betting nature, told James, who was her school friend, to place the   2 million bet to Raj so that he could destroy Bellary and Baireddanna. Raj decides to avenge his father&rsquo;s death and kills Bellary, Baireddanna and his son in a thrilling climax at Rayadurg, rescues Chaitra and distributes Ramamurthy&rsquo;s land to the villagers.</p>

<p>The Story is about Ramachandran a genetic scientist who doesn&rsquo;t get due credit and funds for his research. He tries creating a human with several talents through baby designing, which thus leads to the birth of his sons, who are conjoined together above the waist. Since they share a common heart, doctors suggest a sacrificial surgery, to which their mother Sudha objects. They begin raising their children, Vimalan and Akhilan. In the following years, Ramachandran makes it big with the help of Sudha. His company, Locus Lacto Products, makes huge profit through their product &ldquo;Energion&rdquo;, the top-selling children&rsquo;s powdered milk energy drink in the market. Vimalan and Akhilan are poles apart in character, the former being decent and good at studies while the latter is care-free and poor at studies. Anjali joins their company as a translator. Both Vimalan and Akhilan fall for her. She, along with her Russian friend Volga, a journalist, spend their time with the brothers. Meanwhile, Anjali falls for Vimalan and Akhilan is happy for them. Volga is then revealed to be a spy who tries to steal the trade secrets of Energion. She is exposed and sent out by Ramachandran. She then takes the brothers to their cattle farm under the pretext of an interview where she takes pictures and even collects a milk sample from their farm. When Vimalan questions her, he is warned by her that Energion was an adulterated product and could lead to the death of thousands of children. She also exposes their father of killing the head of their R &amp; D department and setting the lab on fire, thereby destroying evidence. Consequently, she is murdered, but, she swallows a pen-drive containing evidences of the foul-play before dying. Anjali acquires it from the person who performs Volga&rsquo;s autopsy. She hands the pen-drive over to Vimalan. Following this, Vimalan and Akhilan are confronted by goons who try to get the pen-drive from him. Akhilan is convinced that the attack was only meant for robbing them. During this fight, Vimalan suffers a huge blow on the head. Vimalan is declared brain-dead and his heart is transplanted into Akhilan. After the twins are separated through a surgery, Anjali grows closer to Akhilan. Sudha is warned that Energion is adulterated and she confronts her husband who asks the food safety department to raid their company. But to her surprise, Energion is declared safe and hygienic. Meanwhile, Akhilan discovers that his father is behind Vimalan&rsquo;s death by tracking his assistant, Dinesh. He gets hold of the pen-drive that contains several photos, where ingredients used as cattle feed at their farm are declared as no feed. The beginning of the scheme is traced back to the fictional republic of Ukvania. Accompanied by Anjali, Akhilan sets out to solve the mystery. They get her friend Ashok&rsquo;s help, but he is subsequently killed. The photos are revealed to be athletes who were competing as Unified team under the olympic flag in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. The athletes were declared dead in a plane crash. The investigation leads them to the army medical research centre. The truth is then revealed that Energion was originally an undetectable steroid invented by Ramachandran to improve the performance of the athletes at the world games. Though the country performed well, some of the athletes began suffering from similar health problems leading to their deaths and that their death from a plane crash was faked to avoid national shame. They also learn that the adulterant in Energion could be detected only with the addition of ionization enhancer. After being assaulted by a local mafia led by Dinesh, Akhilan manages to kill him and takes the remedial ingredients back to India. Once they are in India, Ramachandran is exposed and is about to be arrested. Akhilan requests his father to surrender but however, he discovers his father&rsquo;s ugly side and finds out that he and his brother are just a result of their father&rsquo;s failed experiment. Ramachandran also states that he used the whole society as his research lab, through Energion. His leg is then crushed by a rock after being unsuccessful in killing his son. Akhilan then leaves his father to die at the hands of rats which chew on his flesh. Akhilan gets National recognition for bravery. He later gets married to Anjali, and the couple subsequently become parents to conjoined twins.</p>
