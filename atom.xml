<p>Watch Dharmveer The Power Man Dharam Veer &ndash; Bollywood Action Movie.  Star Cast : Shivraj Kumar, Charmi, Upendra, Sayaji Shinde.
Synopsis : This is a high voltage action drama that keeps the fans &lsquo;Kush&rsquo; but not lovely from the point of view of class audience. What is expected from two top action heroes who are good in emotion and comedy is not served here in this film. Box office is the only target of the team of this film. Entertainment and age old theory in the wafer thin subject line is not enough with two powerful stars together. Chinnu and Chakri (Shivarajkumar and Upendra) are perfect deal masters. Earning money is their sole intention. Chinnu works for powerful don (played by Sayaji Shinde) whose daughter is Sara (Jennifer Kotwal). Chinnu saves Sara from difficult situation on a few occasions and as expected she is in love with Chinnu. On the other hand Chakri has a perfect match in Sinchana (Charmee). Both are living by duping people. In the entire film with lot of nefarious activities taking police force does not surface.Click <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?p=PL9C54AB16FC45C927">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?p=PL9C54AB16FC45C927</a> to watch more exclusive dubbed version of South Indian full length movies.</p>
