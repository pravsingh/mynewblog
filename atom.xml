Vijay managed to convince the villagers on the Indian side to help in constructing the bridge. But the Chinese villager&#8217;s objected to the bridge under the command of their crooked ruler, Deng Do Rani (Pran), who didn&#8217;t want to have good relations with India. The construction of the bridge started with the help of villagers on the Indian side but to destroy progress, Deng Do Rani sends his goons to disrupt their work and threaten Vijay. But on the contrary Vijay falls in love with one of his goons, Soo Reni (Sharmila Tagore).
