<p>The Story is about SRK who is a real estate contractor. He uses muscle power to encroach land and make money. His business rival Gopala Krishna GK is the &lsquo;Boss&rsquo; of GK Constructions. GK has the power to handle goons as well as the real estate business. He calls for applications from MBA graduates as his personal secretary. None of the applicants reach his expectations. He accidentally meets Anuradha Anu and thinks that she is fit for the job. As a &lsquo;Boss&rsquo; he is tough with his staff but has lots of concern over them. During a trip to Malaysia, Anu and GK get closer and Anu loses her heart to GK. When she is about to confess her love, Anu gets involved in a petty issue and faces the wrath of GK. Consequently, she resigns from her job. GK calls for interviews for his personal secretary again and zeroes in on Sruthi. It is revealed that she was planted in GK&rsquo;s office by SRK. In order to get her father Rammurthy released from a false case, Sruthi steals a tender file. However, she does not hand it over to SRK and demands her father&rsquo;s release. The crooked SRK does not listen to her. At this juncture, she tries to escape from the scene and is saved by GK at the insistence of Anu. However, Anu is injured in the attack by goons in the process, but goes straight to the Tenders office and files the tender to save GK from a huge loss and to fulfill his ambition of securing his dream project. When GK is about to thank her, she admits her love for him, only to learn of his past. In the flashback, GK reveals that he loved Sanjana and married her. She died in a tsunami shortly after. He says he can&rsquo;t replace Sanjana. GK refuses Anu&rsquo;s love politely. As time goes by, Sanjana&rsquo;s mother Sumitra dies of illness in Malaysia and her husband Viswanath tells GK that her last wish is the marriage of GK with Anu. GK also gets a feeling that Sanjana also wants the same. He returns to India and unites with Anu and the film ends on a happy note.</p>

<p>Vijay (Dev Anand), a young and dynamic civil engineer, is assigned with the tasks of bridging the gap between Indian and Chinese villages by constructing a bridge between the two villages. This bridge was going to help them socially as well as economically, but the villagers on both sides of the border didn&rsquo;t want the bridge to be constructed. Vijay managed to convince the villagers on the Indian side to help in constructing the bridge. But the Chinese villager&rsquo;s objected to the bridge under the command of their crooked ruler, Deng Do Rani (Pran), who didn&rsquo;t want to have good relations with India. The construction of the bridge started with the help of villagers on the Indian side but to destroy progress, Deng Do Rani sends his goons to disrupt their work and threaten Vijay. But on the contrary Vijay falls in love with one of his goons, Soo Reni (Sharmila Tagore). Soo Reni also falls in love with Vijay and is moved by the benefits of the bridge after Vijay explains it to her. Deng Do Rani grows furious after he learns about Soo Reni&rsquo;s betrayal and issues orders to kill her. Will Soo Reni survive the odds stacked against her? Can Vijay triumph in his mission to build a bridge and unite the two borders?</p>

<p>The Movie is about an Unemployed, alcoholic slacker lawyer Ravi Goel&rsquo;s life has no meaning and direction until his to-be brother-in-law, Police Inspector Ranbir Singh, offers his frank advise, and instructs him to improve himself so that he and his (Ravi&rsquo;s) sister, Shashi, can finally get married. Ravi gives up drinking, and starts practicing law. He meets with a dancer named Shaila and both fall in love. He finds out that Shaila&rsquo;s brother, Avinash, is missing, and assists her in finding him. He does find him or rather his ashes in a crematorium. This news devastates Shaila, and Ravi takes it upon himself to find the killer. The clue apparently lies in Avinash&rsquo;s swimming pool locker, a video-tape that will throw new light on Ravi, his family, and the killers &ndash; who are not only known to Ravi, but also hold powerful and influential positions in the city. Ravi knows that his next step could make him better or he could regress back into being an alcoholic again.</p>
