The scene shifts to Hyderabad where Cherry is a software engineer in CgTrix. He has an uncle named Jilebi, who unexpectedly runs into trouble and angers the local Don Gandi Babji. Cherry hatches a plan to save Jilebi from Babji and succeeds but falls for Babji&rsquo;s sister Madhu in the process. Though Madhu initially rejects him, after his act of saving children from a mafia don, she reciprocates his love. This angers Babji and he goes to kill him but shocks seeing Cherry shooting the DGP of West Bengal hiding in the bushes. As fate would have it, at this point, The CBI Officer finds out that Cherry is responsible for the two murders, who is innocent in reality. With Jilebi, the CBI Officer goes to Kumbha Mela at Kasi to catch him. Meanwhile when Rawat is offering holy rituals and the CBI Officer catch Cheery and hold him, the look-alike of Cherry, who killed Rawat&rsquo;s Brother, rises from the Ganges and hurts him with a trident, injuring all his men fatally. As he was about to deliver a Finishing Blow, the CBI Officer attcks him and arrests him, exonerating Cherry. Then Cherry comes to know the story of his look-alike. Siddharth Naayak, who goes to his sister&rsquo;s house in Kolkata to pursue higher education. Siddharth shares a strong bond of love and affection with his Sister, Brother-in-Law and his Sister-in-Law Nandini. Siddharth and Nandini are about to be married. Meanwhile his Brother-in-Law, who is a Doctor, attends a case of a minor effected with Steroids by Rawat&rsquo;s Second Brother and sent for Prostitution. He Complaints to the Police but is Killed by Rawat&rsquo;s Second Brother as the Police officer was his Friend. Siddarth is unable to bear this and kills Rawat&rsquo;s Second Brother, thus becoming a Sensational Leader overnight. Soon he seizes each and every property of Rawat and distributes it to the Public. Rawat then kills the Minister, blames Siddharth for it and stabs him with a knife and throws him into the Ganges. Rawat becomes the Minister within a week and Siddharth survives, planning to kill Rawat. Cherry, after listening to his story, decides to help him. Cherry along with Jilebi goes to the CBI Jail where Siddharth is kept under Custody. He introduces himself, and hatches a plan to get Siddharth exonerated. At the Court, since Siddharth admits that he committed the crime, the Judge orders to put Siddharth to death by passing Capital Punishment. But Cherry enters the court, admitting that he is Siddharth Naayak and the one standing there is his fan. Siddharth too tells the same that he is Siddharth and the one who entered the court is his fan. Thus due to Confusion, the Judge orders to CBI to find out real identities of the two persons in a span of 10 Days. In these 10 Days, Siddharth manages to bring Madhu and her family including Babji and his Paternal Uncle (Jaya Prakash Reddy) to Kolkata, thus uniting Cherry and Madhu. Meanwhile the next day, Rawat makes a call to Siddarth to come to his place in order to save the kidnapped school children. But Cherry lifts the phone, listens to the conversation, goes to Rawat&rsquo;s place only to be attacked by Rawat severely. Siddharth reaches the place after seeing an MMS by Rawat, frees Cherry and kills Rawat with the help of Cherry. The Case becomes void because of lack of evidence and in the end, all goes well with the union of Cherry and Madhu and Siddharth and Nandini.</p>
